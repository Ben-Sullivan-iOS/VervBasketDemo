# VervBasketDemo
Quick app demo to add/remove items in an basket and change the currency based on an API call.

The app has been created in a way which makes it very clean and easy to understand.

Every component is small and independant, each module has its own View/Controller and VCModel. The VCModels can conform to the Network service to receive the network response.

Some smoke tests have been added to ensure the Basket is working correctly.

There's a lot more which can be done to the app but this is an example of a few hours work.
